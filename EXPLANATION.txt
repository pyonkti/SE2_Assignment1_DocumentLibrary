Hello Sir/Madam:

I am glad you find here. This document aims at explaining some part of the fuctionality 
I accomplished here.

The static entrance site can be acquired via the url:"http://localhost". This site supports storing
all the data.

I was confused by the way how to output as it is not clarified in the "README.rst".
So my way to get all of the content is by sending "GET" request via this url:"http://localhost/library".
It shall display all the data stored in the hbase, with the information of the server.
I am not sure if I should write html file or js here cause I don't think it should be marked 
ragarding the topic of this assignment. So I skipped this step.

Best regards,
Wei
